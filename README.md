## Project Setup

Considering that you have NodeJS installed in your system, run the following command in your console :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NisargChokshi45/TaskNodeBlogs.git
```

Now, run the following command on your console to download the necessary package dependencies for the project. Once, the command performs its execution, you will see a folder named **Node Modules** in the current project directory.

```bash
npm i
```

Create a **".env"** file in the project directory and create two variables named PORT and MONGO_URL and given them appropriate values. 

After completing the above process, run the following command on the console to get the project up and running. (Use the second command only if you have **nodemon** installed in your system as a local or global module)
```bash
npm start        
npm run dev
```
